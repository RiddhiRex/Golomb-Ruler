# Golomb-Ruler
Introduction
Constraint Satisfaction problems are class of problems where the path to the goal is not important but finding the goal is important. This is achieved when each variable is assigned a value which does not violate any constraint on the variable. 

There are three methods that are used in this project to assign values to the variables: 
Backtracking, Backtracking + Forward Checking, Backtracking+ Constraint Propagation.

Golomb Ruler:
Selecting​ ​M​ ​number​ ​of​ ​marks​ ​for​ ​a​ ​Golomb​ ​ruler​ ​of​ ​the​ ​length​ ​L​ ​is​ ​a​ ​CSP​ ​problem​ ​where​ ​the​ ​constraint​ ​is that​ ​the​ ​length​ ​between​ ​any​ ​two​ ​marks​ ​from​ ​M​ ​marks​ ​must​ ​be​ ​distinct.​ ​The​ ​length​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Golomb​ ​ruler​ ​is the​ ​difference​ ​between​ ​the​ ​first​ ​mark​ ​and​ ​the​ ​last​ ​mark.
